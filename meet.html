                     <h2>Registered Nurse</h2>
                 
                        <p>My background prior to becoming a registered nurse was teacher aiding, working with families which  has stood me in good stead in my role  as a primary health care nurse in workplaces.</p>
                 
                        <p>The workplace is an ideal location  to deliver health and wellness messages in a variety of forums.  The aim is to assist the employees to access the best and most appropriate care to meet their needs. This requires the nurse to have the skill to navigate the complexities of the health services so the employee can reach their full potential in regard to their physical and mental wellbeing.  This is a win win for not only the company and their bottom line but caring for the health and wellness of the individual will benefit the workplace and their family as a whole.</p>

                        <p>I am a registered nurse with current experience in primary health care. The opportunity to go into workplaces and deliver a range of healthcare services is exciting as we take our service directly to the client, minimising work disruption and often identifying neglected health concerns. I am passionate about nursing excellence and making health care as accessible as possible.</p>
