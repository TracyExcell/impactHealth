            <h2>Health and Wellness for Your Employees</h2>
                <h3>What are typical workplace health conditions?</h3>
                
                    <p>Many medical conditions and potential issues remain undiscovered for long periods of time and without active intervention can result in unexplained illness, lack of energy and commitment at work or even just simple inability to concentrate and perform.</p>
                    
                      <p class="moveLeft">Typically conditions can include:</p>
                        
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li>Cardiovascular risk (heart health and circulation)</li>
                             <li>Diabetes – undiagnosed and known</li>
                             <li>Drug and alcohol use</li>
                             <li>Smoking – and related impact on personal and family health</li>
                             <li>Physical inactivity- lack of motivation or disability</li>
                             <li>Excess weight</li>
                             <li>Sleep Apnoea </li>
                             <li>Specific cancers – prostate cancer, cervical, breast or other cancers</li>

                <p>These all have the potential to adversely affect a person’s personal life, their relationships and their ability to deliver at work. Once identified, appropriate action can be taken to reduce or mitigate the effects of these conditions.</p>

                    <p class="moveLeft">These include:</p>
                
                    <ul class="points">
                        <li>The employee is unaware of any underlying health condition</li>

                         <li>The inconvenience and time required to go and see a health professional</li>
