           <h1>How Impact Health can help your business or organisation 
 
</h1>
            <p>Impact health can help improve the productivity of your workplace by ensuring that your employees are physically and mentally well.   This enables employees to work to their potential.  It also reduces absences and improves staff morale and wellbeing.
 
“The 80/20 rule says 80% of your absenteeism and associated drama is related to 20% of your team members who are a well-defined target.”</p>
            
            <div class="wrapper">  
            
            <h2>Information For Employees</h2>
                <p>Personalised Employee Feedback Pack with appropriate actions and recommendations are given.</p>
            
                  <h2>Information for Employers</h2>
                    <h3>Health Assessments</h3>
                    <p>The number of employees seen, how often, whether it was a standard or comprehensive assessment, what was discovered and what actions were taken (non-identifiable).</p>
            
                  
                  <h3>On-going Monitoring</h3>
                    <p>General reporting on what tests were completed, referrals made and results. Conclusions are offered as to the relative health of your workforce with particular areas of interest highlighted.</p>
            
                
                  <h3>Benchmarking</h3>
                    <p>Based on your own databases and national statistics we can benchmark your company against similar organisations and national norms.</p>
            
            </div>
            
            
            <h2>The Link between Health and Work Performance</h2>
            <p>Workplace health has progressed from being a 'nice to have' and 'the right thing to do' to become an integral component of performance strategy. It's self-evident that healthy employees make for healthy organisations and you cannot have one without the other!
The evidence is clear that employees benefit from participating in workplace health programmes which in turn leads to a greater sense of engagement within the organisation.
Employees report improved health awareness and knowledge, improved physical and mental wellbeing and resilience, increased energy and vitality, increased enjoyment and fulfilment, improved concentration and productivity and improved team relationships.</p>
        
        <div class="wrapper">  
            <h2>For employers the benefits of a workplace health programme are multifactorial and include:</h2>
              <ul class="points">
                <li>Improved Productivity</li>
                <li>Increased Creativity and Innovation</li>
                <li>Staff Morale and Organisational Harmony</li>
                <li>Reduced Workplace Injury and ACC Costs</li>
                <li>Reduced Absenteeism</li>
                <li>Reduced Presenteeism-health related work impairment</li>
               </ul>
                   
            <h2>Workplace Health & Wellness Screening</h2>
             <p>Many medical conditions and potential issues remain undiscovered for long periods and without active intervention can result in unexplained illness, lack of energy and commitment at work or even simple inability to concentrate. </p>
          
            </div>
            
            <h2>Typically conditions we look for are:</h2>
             
              <ul class="points">
                  <li>Cardiovascular risk (heart health and circulation)</li>
                  <li>Blood pressure</li>
                  <li>Diabetes - undiagnosed and known</li>
                  <li>Drug and alcohol use</li>
                  <li>Smoking - and related impact on personal and family health</li>
                  <li>Physical inactivity - lack of motivation or disability</li>
                  <li>Excess weight</li>
                  <li>Sleep Apnoea</li>
                  <li>Specific conditions including Prostate Health, Cervical and Breast Screening</li>
                  <li>Wellbeing and mental health issues including - stress, depression, anxiety, tiredness, sleep deprivation</li>
                  <li>Various other conditions - illness, fatigue and other physical and psychosocial needs</li>
                  
                  <p>These all have the potential to adversely affect a person's personal life, their relationships and their ability to deliver at work. Once identified, appropriate action can be taken to reduce or mitigate the effects of these conditions.</p>
